# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

I've created a simple command-line logo maker using node, inquirer, and jest. I've tried to write it using an object-oriented framework

## Installation

You can clone down the repo [here](https://github.com/aimeedarling/SVG-Logo-Maker) then type `node index` in the command-line and follow the prompts to create your logo.

## Usage

Please visit the walk through video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_q-SODgCacndWGw6ddplJ9fimAuyr9V2/view).
You will see making your logo is very easy. I have included some samples in the examples folder.
